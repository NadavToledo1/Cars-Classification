# Cars-Classification
Car classification project leveraging deep learning to classify images into 196 categories. Fine-tuned multiple architectures, tackled challenges like training stability with L2 regularization and gradient clipping, and compared models to optimize performance. Gained hands-on experience in deep learning design, training, and evaluation.
