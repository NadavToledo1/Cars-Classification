# Car Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on classifying car images into 196 categories using deep learning techniques. The work emphasizes data exploration, model development, and experimental evaluation, showcasing a robust approach to image classification.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three primary Jupyter notebooks:

1. Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb

Conducts a detailed analysis of the Stanford Cars dataset.
Visualizes data distributions, class imbalances, and image characteristics.
Prepares data for training, including preprocessing and augmentation.

2. Models.ipynb

Implements and fine-tunes multiple neural network architectures for car classification.
Adapts pre-trained models by replacing the final layer to match the task.
Includes techniques like L2 regularization and gradient clipping to stabilize training.
Provides detailed metrics, including validation and test performance.

3. Experiments.ipynb

Documents hyperparameter tuning and comparative analysis of different architectures.
Evaluates model behavior across iterations, identifying performance bottlenecks.
Offers insights into challenges faced during training and potential improvements.

## Dataset
The project uses the Stanford Cars Dataset, which contains 16,185 images of cars categorized into 196 classes. Images are annotated with class labels, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks.

## Key Features
- Hands-on implementation and fine-tuning of deep learning architectures.
- Extensive use of regularization and training stabilization techniques.
- Comparative analysis of models to evaluate performance across multiple metrics.
- Exploration of computational limitations and creative solutions to improve results.
