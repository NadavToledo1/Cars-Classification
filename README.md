# Cars-Classification
This project provided valuable insights into the process of building and fine-tuning neural networks. By implementing various architectures and adapting them for car classification tasks, I deepened my understanding of model design, training, and optimization. Through hands-on coding, experimentation, and iterative improvement, I enhanced my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, extensive reading and research on state-of-the-art methods enriched our knowledge and experience, enabling us to approach challenges more effectively and critically evaluate the performance of different approaches. This comprehensive learning process has been instrumental in advancing my expertise in deep learning and practical application. This project also presented numerous challenges that pushed me to develop creative solutions. Classifying images into 196 different categories using RGB inputs required a deep understanding of the dataset and careful model design. I experimented with improvements like L2 regularization and gradient clipping to stabilize training and enhance performance. Throughout the process, I built and compared three different networks, meticulously analyzing their performance at each stage to understand their behavior and identify areas for improvement. These efforts deepened my understanding of model development and evaluation, even as I navigated computational limitations. I remain confident that with better resources, my results could be significantly better.
